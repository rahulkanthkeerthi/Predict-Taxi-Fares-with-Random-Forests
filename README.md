# Predict-Taxi-Fares-with-Random-Forests

Project Description

In this project, I worked with the data from a large number of taxi journeys in New York from 2013. I used regression trees and random forests to predict the value of fares and tips, based on location, date and time. 

The dataset used in this project is a sample from the complete 2013 NYC taxi data, which was originally obtained and published by Chris Whong.

Project Tasks:

•	49999 New York taxi trips
•	Cleaning the taxi data
•	Zooming in on Manhattan
•	Where does the journey begin?
•	Predicting taxi fares using a tree
•	It's time. More predictors.
•	One more tree!
•	One tree is not enough
•	Plotting the predicted fare
•	Plotting the actual fare
•	Where do people spend the most?
